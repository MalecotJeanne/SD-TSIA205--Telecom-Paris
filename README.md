# SD-TSIA205--Telecom-Paris

In many situations, the complexity of the data available to the statistician is such that, at least in the first analysis, parametric modeling is not possible. The aim of this course is to present less rigid statistical techniques, as well as the theoretical issues inherent in their implementation: the counterpart of the increased flexibility of non-parametric approaches lies in the risk of "over-fitting" the model to the data.
Examples are given of the "minimax" point of view for non-parametric estimation, the "bias/variance" trade-off as a function of model "complexity", and an introduction to the statistical learning paradigm of "empirical risk minimization".
